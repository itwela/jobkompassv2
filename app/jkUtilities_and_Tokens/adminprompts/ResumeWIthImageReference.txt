Create an elegant, professional résumé layout designed for a tech industry professional. The background should be minimalistic, with a clean white or light gray tone. The design should emphasize clarity and organization, with clear sections for personal information, education, experience, projects, skills, and contact details. 
Each section should be separated with subtle yet distinct lines or soft background shading to delineate areas without overwhelming the viewer. 
The personal info section should have the name in bold, large text, with the contact details neatly aligned below, presented in a small but readable font. The experience and education sections should use subheadings with slightly smaller text and bullet points for key information, creating a balanced, structured feel.
For the projects section, each project should be visually highlighted with short descriptions and icons to symbolize the technologies used. The skills section should be arranged in a clean grid or list layout to emphasize key technical skills.
The design should be modern and clean, using a sleek sans-serif font for readability and consistency across all sections. Include space for a profile photo in the top corner, and ensure there’s a sense of flow from one section to the next. The image should exude a sense of professionalism and clarity, suitable for a tech industry résumé.
